## Day 1
<ul>
  <li>Today, was my brainstorming day.
<li> I thought about cool projects that I could make and looked at projects from previous sessions
  <li> I stumbled upon pong and remembered what a fun game it was so I decided to recreate it
    <li>I am excited to see how it pans out </ul>
    

## Day 2
<ul>
  <li> My task was to get started with the most complicated things in the project
    <li> In my opinion the ball mechanism was a big challenge as it had to bounce a certain way, increase in speed, had to die out if it touched the right or left edge only
      <li> Started with the ball, figured out the bounce mechanism and increasing speed. Unable to figure out how to end the round when it hits the width of the screen.
        </ul>
        
## Day 3
<ul>
  <li> Focussed on different things today
    <li> Made the introscreen, with the original pong text and set it such that pressing space triggers the main game
      <li> Made changes to speed and bounce mechanisms
        <li> Facing a lag issue. More than one ball on the screen at any point. Can lead to user confusion. Must find a fix. Asked on the discord channel
          <li> Problem illustrated in this video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qxkt9FsCjmaRPXf9MspU0YoPL5xJ3F3M/view?usp=sharing
          </ul>

## Day 4
<ul>
  <li> Got in touch with professor about lag issue. Learnt that it is an inherent issue that cannot really be solved.
    <li> Attended a soldering workshop
      <li> Realized that I needed bigger potentiometers for my game. So I borrowed some from the lab and went after hours to the open soldering stations to solder wires onto the potentimeter
        </ul>
