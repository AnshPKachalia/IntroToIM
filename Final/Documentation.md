# Final Project- Pong Game

## Introduction
As a child, one of my fondest memories was to play the pong game with my brother. As I grew up, and games becomes a lot more interactive and detailed, pong is one of the few games that have still stuck around. Originally made in 1972 by Atari, this game is still available online, in arcades and a few bars. When presented this assignment, I was immediately taken back to my childhood and I decided that this is the game I want to create.
I decied to stay true to the original game and have thus used the same font and colors. While, it may lead to the game being somewhat simplistic I did not want to takeaway from the nostalgia and thus, to add a layer of complexity I made certain tweaks that change the gameplay but not how the game looks. 
In this game I used 2 potentiometers, to control two paddles on screen. The goal is to deflect the ball using your paddle and to not let it pass through. The first one to reach 5 points wins. To add some complexity and to make it more competitive, I have programmed it such that based on the score difference between the two players, the sizes of the paddles get adjusted to be able to inflict a disadvantage against the individual leading. 

## Diary
I kept a log of my process and daily progress. The link to which is:
