## 3 Assignments plus Extra Credit

### Assignment 1
#### Make something that uses only one sensor on Arduino and makes the ellipse in Processing move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on Arduino is controlled by Processing

#### Assignment 3
#### Take the gravity wind example (https://github.com/aaronsherwood/introduction_interactive_media/blob/master/processingExamples/gravityExamples/gravityWind/gravityWind.pde) and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor

#### Extra Credit 
#### Make a simple game that involves some kind of communication between Arduino and Processing

#### Concept 
I tried to change my midterm game by adding a push button and coding it such that when the push button was pressed it would correspond to the jump key in my dino jumping game.

#### Problems
I had no problems with assignments 1,2 or 3. They helped me understand the communication between arduino and processing better.
In assignment 4 I got it to work but because the jump in my midterm was a bit glitchy adding the button required me to drop a keypressed code. When I did so, the dino would jump up but would not go down. Nevertheless, I have uploaded the code for it.
