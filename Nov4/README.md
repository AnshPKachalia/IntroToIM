## Creative Button
In this project we were required to use a creative idea for a button/switch in a circuit. I spent a lot of time figuring out a creative way to complete a circuit and link to an application that is useful in real life. Thus, I tried to think of a contraption that would involve a door or a window and would light up a bulb anytime the door or window is opened. This is something I have often seen in fridges and wardrobes and is very helpful and simple to make.

### Process
I used duct table to connect one spoon to the edge of the door and also to connect the wire to the spoon. Then I placed another spoon on my desk and connect a wire to it. When I kicked the door open the two spoons touced, completing the circuit. Instead of keeping the light always on, as you would expect in a real life applcuation of such a circuit, I made it say "hi" in morse code, just to add a little bit of a fun element.

### Difficulties and overcoming them
1. I did not know morse code and what a blink means and how much time needs to be there between alphabets and words. I had to use a convertor that converted words to morse code and read up about the time gaps that need to exist (1 second between blinks, 3 seconds between aplhabets and 7 seconds between words).
2. I had created a basic circutit, similar to the one we made in class but could not figure out why it was not working. After rechecking all connections and comparing them with the code, I realised that one of the wires was plugged into A3 but in my code I had written A2 because of the parallax and not looking at the circuit from above.
3. Lastly, the major difficulty came in the creative aspect of the assignment. It was easy to connect two pieces of metal to complete the circuit but not being able to use our hands was a challenge. I also wanted my project to have a little bit of real life application and finding a creative solution for this took me longer than expected. But I am happy with what I acheiveed.
