### Concept
In this project, I was trying to use a digital and analog input and use information from them to control a buzzer. The digital input consists of three buttons and the analog input is the potentiometer. Each button is associated with a different frequency and when you press it the buzzer plays the frequency. As the potentiometer reading increases or decreases, it changes the frequency associated with each button and thus a combination of both can be used to create sound using the buzzer that will act as an instrument.

### My process
First, I began to assemble the circuit based on the previous projects done in class. I aligned 3 buttons in the circuit <br> Then I used basic fucntions from the exmaples to test if everything had been connected correctly and was working. <br>
Then, I did the same with the buzzer and the potentiometer until I had ensured that each component was connected properly and was working as I wanted it to <br>
Then, I began to think of the code and for inspiration<br>
I then decided to simply experiment with frequencies and finding chords that are used in my favourite songs. <br>
I combined the chords and used my very limited musical knowledge to create an instrument<br>

### Problem
I did not have any major problems in this assignment. I believe I had a little trouble remmebering how to place a potentiometer and buzzer correctly in a circuit, but I used the discord group for help on that. Above that my limited music knowledge proved to be a hindrance as I am sure I could have tweaked my project to account for various musical chords and played an actual song. But because I had no knowledge of chords or how to play songs, I stuck to a basic instrument that may or may not even sound right.
