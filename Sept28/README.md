## Generative text or data visualization
In this project, I intially started with an idea for generative text. I was pondeirng over this thought that I had heard of, which mentioned that if monkeys keep typing random alphabets, at one pont they will type out a shakespeare novel. So using that idea, I downloaded a dataset of all english words. I then googled the length of an average sentence and found out that it is 15 words. Thus, I made a code to randomly select 15 words from the dataset and dipslay them in a single line, with the hope that I could atleast create a sentence that had some meaning. I thought this would be challenging enough, but once I coded for it, I found out that it was pretty straightforward. I kept running the code again and again but failed to see sentences being created. But I hope one day that this code will generate a sentence. The output looked like this:
