## Generative text or data visualization
### Project 1 
In this project, I intially started with an idea for generative text. I was pondeirng over this thought that I had heard of, which mentioned that if monkeys keep typing random alphabets, at one pont they will type out a shakespeare novel. So using that idea, I downloaded a dataset of all english words from Kaggle. I then googled the length of an average sentence and found out that it is 15 words. Thus, I made a code to randomly select 15 words from the dataset and dipslay them in a single line, with the hope that I could atleast create a sentence that had some meaning. I thought this would be challenging enough, but once I coded for it, I found out that it was pretty straightforward. I kept running the code again and again but failed to see sentences being created. But I hope one day that this code will generate a sentence. The output looked like this:

I think the major challenge in dealing with this was to simply space them out enough so the words did not overlap each other and to find a large enough dataset that could enlist most if not all words in the english language. But as this was fairly simplictic, I decided to make another project.
### Project 2
In my second project, I recalled a conversation I had with a friend, about covid cases and management in various states of India. I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle with information of the total cases and recoveries in each Indian state. Then I coded them such that it produced two circles overlaid on each other, one for total cases and one for recoveries for each state. The gap between the two overlaid circles gave an indication of how well were the active cases handled within the state, larger gap=poorly managed. 
The challenge came when I was producing random circles with random colors, but needed the same location and color for the two circles that correlated to the same state. I did not realize that it would be as easy as coding the two cirles within the same function and struggled on aligning them for a while. I was happy with the output I produced.
